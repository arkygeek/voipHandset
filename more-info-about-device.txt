Based on the provided information, it seems like the device has a complex behavior
associated with the handset, cradle, and call management.

Here's a summary of the inferred behavior based on your description:

Handset Placement in Cradle:

When the handset is placed in the cradle, the device determines the action based
on the last button pressed.

If the hold button was pressed before placing the handset in the cradle, the call
should not be hung up but placed on hold.

If the big button was pressed, the audio output should switch to the cradle speaker f
rom the handset speaker.

For all other buttons previously pressed, the device should hang up the call.
Cradle Pickup:

When the cradle is picked up, it returns a different value to indicate that it
was placed down in a specific state.

The specific state could be associated with the last action taken before placing
the cradle down.

It's important to note that the described behavior is inferred based on the typical
functionalities associated with handset and cradle interactions.

The actual behavior may vary depending on the device's firmware or software implementation.

If you have access to the device's documentation, it would be beneficial to review
it for detailed information on call management, button functionalities, and
interaction with the cradle. Additionally, the firmware or software of the device
may have specific APIs or commands that control these actions, and that information
would be crucial for understanding and implementing the desired behavior programmatically.

There are TWO DIFFERENT audio streaming interfaces, each associated with a different type of speaker:

Audio Streaming Interface 2:
---------------------------
Terminal Type: USB Streaming
Channels: 2 (Left Front and Right Front)
Channel Configuration: Left Front (L), Right Front (R)
Terminal ID: 14
Type: Speaker (wTerminalType: 0x0301)


Audio Streaming Interface 3:
---------------------------
Terminal Type: USB Streaming
Channels: 1
Channel Configuration: Not specified
Terminal ID: 10
Type: USB Streaming (wTerminalType: 0x0101)
These interfaces represent different audio endpoints for speakers. Interface 2 is configured for stereo output, while Interface 3 is configured for a single channel output. These could correspond to different speakers or audio output configurations on the device.
